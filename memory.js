// Memory Usage in JavaScript

// STACK

// Contains all the primitives and copies in memory.

// Contains all the information about the function call order.

// Whenever we invoke a function, a new frame is created and pushed to the top of the stack.

// It offers copy of the primitive values and references to functions and objects in the heap for the function to use.

// It is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure.



// Heap

// This is an unstructured memory pool which stores all the objects including the boxed primitives.

// Whenever we create an object, itâ€™s always created inside the heap segment.

// The heap is a large region of memory that can be used to store information.

// It offers refererences to the objects stored in the heap.
